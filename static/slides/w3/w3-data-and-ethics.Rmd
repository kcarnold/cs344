## AI Ethics?

## AI Ethics Beyond Killer Robots

- AI needs data (privacy)
  - ...and empowers organizations that aggregate data
- AI needs lots of computation
- AI's outputs affect people
  - predictions and decisions (bias, discrimination, gig labor, ...)
  - how we perceive each other (and ourselves)
  - how we perceive ideas (misinformation)
- AI does things that people once did
- AI systems can be attacked in new ways
- AI embeds values about what is human
- AI tells us about our own intelligence

---

## Hypothetical Example: Shoplifting Prediction System

- Problem: busy store, too many cameras to monitor
- Input: surveillance camera video
- Output: people, labeled by likelihood to shoplift

What issues might come up?

--

- **bias**
- **transparency / explainability**

---

## Hypothetical Example: Resume Screening 

- Problem: many candidates, many jobs
- Input: resumes, job description
- Output: ranked list of most promising matches

What issues might come up?

--

- **bias**
- **feedback loops**

---

## Hypothetical Example: News Recommendation

- Problem: too much going on (information overload)
- Input: articles
- Output: ranked list of articles for me to readable

What issues might come up?

--

- **feedback loops**
- **measurement bias**
- potential for **adversarial manipulation**

---

## Hypothetical Example: Popularity Prediction

- Problem: past ad campaigns fell flat.
- Input: image to be used in social media marketing
- Output: predicted level of engagement (likes, shares, comments)

What issues might come up?

--

- **measurement bias**
- **stereotyping**
- **clickbait**

# A few questions to ask about ML

- General
  - Is our data *representative*? (vs, e.g., feedback loops)
  - Were stakeholders involved in the design?
  - How vulnerable is the system to attack?
- Performance
  - Robust? Reliable?
  - Testable
- Clarity
  - Are results accurate in real-world?
  - Are system's biases understood and reported?
  - Is there recourse if the system is wrong?
  - Can decisions be explained?

## Why transparency?

Did this classifier successfully learn to recognize a "dumbbell"?

## Data Splitting

**Why**: Confidence about deployment

**How**:

* Hide a test set
* Single split (train-valid): [`RandomSplitter`](https://docs.fast.ai/data.transforms.html#RandomSplitter) or similar
* or: cross-validation

---

## Data Loading

.pull-left[
**Why**: Model expects data in ideal format, cleanly chunked... real world is messy.

**How**: pipeline of transformations (to *items*, to *batches*)
]

---

**Code**:

Work through the [`DataBlock` tutorial](https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.datablock.html).

`ImageDataLoader.from_name_func` is convenient way to construct a `DataBlock`
and `DataLoader`

---

## Batches

**Why**: Often more efficient to process several items at once; more confident in how to update weights

**How**:

* need to align sizes of each image (or text document, or sound, or ...)
* limited by GPU memory (especially for the *backward* pass)

## Diagnosing Classifiers

- **Why**: Better *quantify* performance (e.g., sensitivity vs specificity), better *understand* performance (analyze errors)
- **How**: [Confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity#Confusion_matrix); False Positive vs False Negative.

Example: Automotive collision avoidance system *predicts imminent collisions*

- consequence of false positive? false negative?
- effect of adjustments

## Averages Hide.

## Data Augmentation

**Why**: Discourage overfitting. Encourage generalization.

**How**: move the camera around (images), skip words (text), add / subtract stuff.

*Related*: mess with the model itself, e.g., Dropout.

Examples of what specific transforms can be used

## Running Experiments

* Reproducibility
  * `set_seed`
  * Restart and Run All
* Variability
  * try different seeds
  * try different modeling choices
  * **Keep a log** (e.g., spreadsheet with one line per run)

## Tools

---

## List Comprehensions

Often readable and declarative. Use judiciously.

.pull-left[
```{python}
result = []
for i in range(4):
  if i % 2 == 1:
    for j in range(i):
      result.append(f'i={i} j={j}')
result
```
]

.pull-right[
```{python}
[
  f'i={i} j={j}'
  for i in range(4)
  if i % 2 == 1
  for j in range(i)
]
```
]

- `dict` and `set` comprehensions work similarly.
- Numerical libraries often provide "broadcast" alternatives: `x * y` works elementwise when either is `np.array` or `torch.Tensor`

---

## Jupyter Notebooks

- execution order issues: Restart and Run All
- kernel vs webpage: it's still running when you close the page!
- Tracebacks:
  - *What is the error*? look at the end. "What is it talking about?"
  - *What triggered it*? look for your own code (farther up)

---

## Markdown

```markdown
*italic*, **bold**

# heading

## heading 2

- list
- list 2
```

## How to ask a good question

- There are no stupid questions in this class. But there are *lazy* questions.
- You must learn to *ask well*.

*What makes a well-asked question?*
