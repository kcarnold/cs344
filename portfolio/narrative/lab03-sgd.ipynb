    "Suppose I have two boxes (A and B), each of which have a bunch of small beads in them. Peeking inside, it looks like there are 3 different colors of beads (red, orange, and yellow), but the two boxes have very different colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each box has a lever on it. When I push the lever, a bead comes out of the box. (We can assume it's a random one, and we'll put the bead back in the box it came from so we don't lose beads.)\n",
    "\n",
    "My friend suggests we play a game: they'll pick a box and press the lever a few times; I have to guess what color beads are going to come out. But I complain that I'm never going to be able to guess 100% correctly, since the boxes have mixtures of beads in them. So here's what they propose: I can spread out my one guess among the different colors, e.g., 0.5 for red and 0.25 for orange or yellow--as long as they add up to 1. Okay...sounds good?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though there's no way I could count the number of each color bead in each box (way too many!), I think I can do well at this game after a few rounds. What do you think?"
