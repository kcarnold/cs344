You might apply image classification to a different task (e.g., places, people, foods, etc.). Since you should be able to get a baseline approach working quickly, here are some ways you can deepen this kind of project:

-   Analyze the model's **errors**, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

-   **Compare several approaches.** You can consider differences in model architecture, specific task, hyperparameter choices, inclusion/exclusion criteria, etc. Remember to think about the choice of **metrics** and the **uncertainty** involved in any estimate of them.

-   Generate **explanations** of the classification decisions, using the model interpretation methods described in the book or otherwise.

-   Discuss how you were able to **tune** the performance of the classifier.
