The notebooks include all of the details.

## Feedback

- Next time, please copy and paste the Analysis questions into the textbox here.
- Next time, include headings to separate the responses for each notebook.
- Next time, please keep the original names of the notebooks.

Hopefully quick revisions:

- diagnose-classifier: Be careful about the difference between percentage and fraction. An accuracy of .99 is 99% accurate or 1% error rate.
- diagnose-classifier: Predicted True = predicted "cat", so the 6 is actually cases where the classifier predicted *cat* but it was wrong.
- diagnose-classifier: loss can be high even for correctly classified images if the classifier *wasn't confident* in its predictions. (Better to be confidently correct than un-confidently correct, and better that than confidently wrong.)
- diagnose-classifier: loss is directly derived from probability: loss is `-log(prob)` when the clf was right, `-log(1-prob)` when the clf was wrong
- compute-grad analysis is overcomplicated. Use only basic math operations like `+` or `*`; don't use any autograd functionality (like `.backward()`).
- compute-grad analysis: `x1_grad` is incorrect (try it for several different values, or think symbolically about the derivative of the function)
- compute-grad analysis: compute-grad: The function is f(x1, x2) = 2x1 + x2^2 + 5. x1_grad = df/dx1 = 2 (note that it doesn't depend on x2. Now try the same for x2_grad.
- image-ops: mean image didn't work. Use `axis=0` or `axis=1` etc.
- image-ops: blacking out part of the image didn't work. See [the revised instructions](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/22sp/fundamentals/u2n2-image-ops.html), search for the phrase "assign to slices".
- image-ops: only-red-channel didn't work. Use assignment like the previous problem.

Optional revisions:

- diagnose-classifier: the probability number is actually the probability that the classifier assigned to the decision that it made. (I think it should be the probability that it assigns to the *correct* answer, but they're not going to change that now.)
- image ops: grayscale should have used the average of all 3 channels (mean on axis 1)
- black-out could have used negative indexing (e.g., `-50:`)
