## Goals

This Reflection invites you to reflect on what you learned in Units 3 and 4.

It is simplified relative to the previous one. It's now almost entirely for you (not for the course staff). It's for you to **reflect on your learning**: what have you learned? What needs more practice? What do you need to ask for help about?

It also gives an invitation for you to give general comments and feedback to the instructor.

## Mastery Grades

By default, the following assignments will be assessed for mastery grades for this Reflection Interval:

- Homework 3
- Lab 4 (post-lab questions are optional this time)
- Homework 4

Note: many people will have revisions to Homework 2 to turn in also.

**Alternative Assessments**: Different people may have unique ways of demonstrating their mastery of concepts. Also, people resonate with different learning objectives. If you resonated with something this Reflection Interval that is not well represented in the assignments above, describe what learning objectives you resonated with and what you've produced that demonstrates mastery of them.

## Instructions

Copy and paste the learning objectives from Unit 3 and Unit 4. For each objective, either:

- Write a brief (one paragraph) response to that objective. e.g., for Unit 4, you would write a paragraph where you "Describe the basic structure of a machine learning model."
- **or**: copy and paste something that you've already produced that responds to that objective. e.g., for Unit 3, you might copy and paste the part of Homework 3 where you "Explain the importance of evaluating image classifiers on unseen data."
- List any remaining questions or uncertainties you have about this objective. (It's perfectly fine to list nothing for most objectives.)

> **This is for *you*.** The *process* of trying to recall and explain these concepts will help you organize and store knowledge. You won't get nearly as much benefit if you just Google and paraphrase.

Also, if you turned in anything **late** during this Reflection Interval, specify what work it is and specify how many Effort points it should be awarded according to the late work policy described in the Syllabus.

Finally, please include any thoughts on your mind about how the class is going for you so far. Suggested prompt for this week:

- What's been your favorite thing we've done so far?
- How is the structure of this class going for you? (I'm sorry that things have been changing; it should be settling out soon!)

## Revisions

Simplified process: if you are *revising* an assignment from a previous Reflection Interval:

- Submit a complete, standalone solution on Moodle. (Clean up anything from your past errors.)
- **Email the instructor** with the following:
  - What assignment you're revising
  - A concise and specific explanation of the original error(s) and how you addressed them.
