## Goals

Reflections have two goals:

- For **you** to reflect on your learning: what have you learned? What needs more practice? What do you need to ask for help about?
- For **course staff** to know what work you think demonstrates your mastery of the learning objectives, to give you credit and feedback for that work.

## Instructions

Include the following in your reflection this week:

1. Evidence that you have achieved at least one of the learning objectives from Unit 1.

    - Copy and paste the specific learning objective from the [Unit 1 objectives](../).
    - Indicate the name of the assignment that demonstrates that you have achieved that objective.
      - Single quiz questions, especially from preparation quizzes, are generally not sufficient evidence of mastery. However:
        1. They can always be useful to strengthen other evidence.
        2. Particularly thoughtful essay responses can be an exception. (Consider making a post on the class blog if so!)
      - If you do want to use a quiz towards mastery credit, copy and paste the relevant part into the reflection itself.
    - In a sentence or two, argue that the assignment demonstrates your achievement.
    - List any remaining questions or uncertainties you have about this or other objectives.

2. Repeat, for [Unit 2 objectives](../).

3. What work, if any, you are turning in late. For each activity, specify how many Effort points it should be awarded according to the late work policy described in the Syllabus.

> Future *Reflection* assignments will only ask about one unit, but will also ask what assignment you've *revised* for mastery credit. You will include a concise description of your specific errors and what you did to fix them.
