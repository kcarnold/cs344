title: "Discussion 2: Should I be worried about AI?"
---

This week we are getting introduced to some ethical and practical challenges in AI. While we'll return to this topic many times throughout the semester, let's start with an overview.

These discussion posts are designed to give you practice answering the sorts of questions you might actually get as an AI scientist and practitioner. For this week:

> Picture a discussion around your family table. **Suppose a family member asks you**: Should I be worried about AI?

(You should have a specific family member in mind, but don't tell us details about them.) In this week's Discussion forum, please post a brief (50--200 word) statement where you *either*:

- Respond to a concern that you know they actually have (how realistic is it, what are some mitigating factors, etc.)
- *or*: tell them about something new that they might find concerning (e.g., from the book chapter or video).

Also read your peers' posts and reply to one or two. You might, for example, ask a follow-up question that you imagine your family member might ask---or answer their question in your own way.
