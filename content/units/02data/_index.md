title: "Unit 2: Data"
weight: 2
---

Students who complete this unit will demonstrate that they can:

- Describe the structure of the data provided as input to an image classifier in terms of batches and labels
- Contrast a training set and validation set; explain appropriate uses of both
- Adapt Python code to load data to be used by an image classifier.
- Implement basic numerical computing operations using PyTorch
- Implement numerical computing operations on multidimensional arrays using PyTorch

## Preparation

- Read {{< fastbook num="2" nbname="02_production.ipynb" >}}
    - *note: ignore the implementation details of `class DataLoaders`*; you only need to know that it has a  `.train` and a `.valid`, each of which are `DataLoader`s that turn filenames into batches of `(image, label)` pairs.
    - If you want to replicate the code, use duckduckgo (as the Unit 1 video does) instead of trying to get a Bing API key.
- Start reading {{< fastbook num="3" nbname="03_ethics.ipynb" >}}
    - *note*: you can spread out this reading between this week and next week.
- Watch {{< fastvideo num="2" >}}
- Complete the preparation quiz in Moodle.

Note: to get the Jupyter Notebook extensions that Jeremy discusses on the lab machines, run the following at a Terminal:

```sh
pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
```

<!-- Note for next year: 

- We need a diagram of an image tensor!
- Chapter 13, "A color picture is a rank-3 tensor" -- shows the decomposition of an image into its 3 color channels.

-->

### Optional Supplemental Material

Read the paper that introduced a well-known dataset: [ImageNet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5206848), Microsoft [COCO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0312v3), [MNIST](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/726791), etc.

    - interfaces for notebooks: Jupyter (classic and Lab), VS Code, Kaggle, Google Colab (view-only: github, nbviewer)
    - cell types
      - Markdown ([GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github), [spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/))
      - Code
        - Each code block feeds input to a hidden Python repl ("Shell" in Thonny)
          - Possible to run code out of order
          - Changing something doesn't make dependent code re-run!
        - Outputs: anything explicitly `display()`ed or `print()`ed or `plot()`ted---and the result of the *last expression*
  - Model training
    - Outline of notebooks
      1. Load the data
          1. Download the dataset.
          2. Get a list of filenames.
          3. Get a list of ground-truth labels.
          4. Set up the dataloaders (which handles train-test split, batching, and resizing)
      2. Train a model
          1. Get a foundation model (resnet18 in our case)
          2. Fine-tune it.
      3. Get the model's predictions on an image.
  - Evaluating a model
    - *Accuracy*: correct or incorrect?
    - *Loss*:
      - partial credit
      - when it's right, should be confident
      - when it's wrong, *shouldn't* be confident
