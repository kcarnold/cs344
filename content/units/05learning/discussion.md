title: "Discussion 3: How does AI work?"
---

These discussion posts are designed to give you practice answering the sorts of questions you might actually get as an AI scientist and practitioner. For this week, let's pretend **you're getting interviewed by a journalist about AI**. This will be livestreamed to a large audience, so you want to practice your answers to a wide range of questions before you go on air. They might get into some technical details, so you should be prepared to explain some of the concepts we've covered so far, but you should also be able to explain the big picture.

We'll organize this discussion around the *questions* that you might get asked. So:

1. Make a post in the discussion forum with a question that you might get asked. To keep the questions focused, **use the learning objectives from so far in this course** (see the web page for each unit). Try not to post the same question that someone else has already posted.
2. Reply to **someone else**'s question post with an answer. We're trying to collectively construct the best answer we could give. If someone has already answered well, you can add an answer that goes into more detail, or you can offer an alternative explanation. Include a link to a relevant video or article if you can find one.
3. Optionally, reply with any follow-up questions that you imagine the interviewer might ask.
