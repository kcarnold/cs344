title: "Discussion 1: What's AI useful for?"
---

This week we are getting introduced to some history and application of AI. To help understand the landscape of AI and also get introduced to each other, let's survey some examples that students find interesting.

> **Suppose someone asks you**: What's AI useful for?

In this week's Discussion forum, please post a brief (50--200 word) statement where you:

- Give an example of an application of AI that you find interesting or important. 
  - This year, **ChatGPT and DALL-E are taboo**. (Applications built on them are ok, though.)
  - Include an image of the system in action, or a link to something that describes it.
- Describe what about its behavior merits the description "intelligent".

Also read your peers' posts and try to reply to a few.

### Where to find AI examples?

- Think of some topic outside of computing that you find important or interesting. Search for "AI" or "ML" combined with that term.
- Pick a large company and look at their "AI blog" (or sometimes "tech blog" or "engineering blog")
- Providers of AI computing, like NVIDIA, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc. like to show off what people are doing with their tools
- Lots of YouTubers, podcasters, bloggers, news sources, etc. like to talk about AI; see Resources for some examples.
- https://PapersWithCode.com/ especially their [newsletter](https://paperswithcode.com/newsletter)
- AI work shows up at many academic conferences.

You can also ask on Ed for help finding examples of a particular kind.
