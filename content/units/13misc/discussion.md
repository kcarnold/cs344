title: "Discussion: Fans and Skeptics, Optimists and Pessimists"
---

You've just taken an AI class. You might get asked: where is AI going? And is it good or bad? Now that you've engaged with the details of how some AI systems work, you're much more qualified than average to answer those questions. But even experts disagree about those questions.

Some people are impressed by AI developments (we'll call them "fans"). Others are skeptical (we'll call them "skeptics"). Some people are optimistic about how AI will improve society ("optimists"). Others are worried, to the point of worrying about the future of humanity (we could call them "pessimists", but maybe instead we'll call them "concerned"). And some people are both impressed and concerned, or skeptical and optimistic, or any other combination.

To be wise, we should consider various points of view: fans and skeptics, optimists and concerned.

## Instructions

Read two articles with different perspectives. Read with hospitality: you'll need to be able to articulate the other side's point of view.

1. For your first article:
    - Provide a well-formatted link (that indicates the source without having to click it).
    - State the overall stance in a keyword or two, e.g., `[skeptical, optimistic]` or `[fan, concerned]`
    - Summarize your first article in a few sentences. Make your summary convince someone who holds a different view to at least open the article and read it. (Yeah, you can use ChatGPT, but give it some guidance and edit its response.)
2. Repeat for your second article.
3. Articulate your own nuanced position, drawing on both articles. What stance should we take?
    - You are highly encouraged, but not required, to draw on what you have learned about Reformed Christian perspectives on technology in this and other classes. Examples:
      - Creation (unfolding latent potential possibilities, the Image of God, work as good)
      - the Fall (and its effect on relationships, work, and technology), idolatry, Mammon, etc.
      - Redemption and Restoration (Jesus reconciling *everything*), shalom (right relationships, flourishing, peace, rest, justice)

## Responses

Read a few of your classmates' responses to learn about their articles and positions. Respond to at least one of them. 

## Articles

Here is a sample of a few recent (and a few not-so-recent) ones. Lengths vary widely, my apologies. Note that I have not included many "fans" here, because they should be very easy to find on the Internet these days. For example, look at any tech company's AI blog, or any AI conference's website, or techie YouTube channels.
