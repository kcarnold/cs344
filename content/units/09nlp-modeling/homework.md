Our goals for the homework assignment this week are:

- Practice working with language modeling logits

## This Week's Fundamentals

There's only one notebook this week, designed to help you practice with language modeling. As usual, do your work in the corresponding notebook.

- {{% fundamentals name="Logits in Causal Language Models" nbname="u9n1-lm-logits.ipynb" %}}

## Submitting

I recommend working on the other answers outside of Moodle (e.g., in Word or Google Docs), then copy-pasting in.

In the Moodle assignment for this Homework:

1. Attach the `ipynb` file.
2. Copy and paste your responses to the Analysis questions into the text box.
