Our goals for the homework assignment this week are:

- Practice working with language modeling logits
- Fill in gaps in your PyTorch knowledge

## Tutorials

By now we've worked with PyTorch a lot, but there are probably some gaps in your knowledge. PyTorch has extensive [tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials) on various topics, at various different levels, so everyone should be able to find something to learn there. So: **pick two resources** from the tutorials, **work through them on your own**, and **write a paragraph** about your experience for each. *Try to make this something you learn from, not just something you "get through".*

Notice that the left menu on the PyTorch tutorials list has many categories. Pick something from **two different categories**. I recommend considering:

- PyTorch Recipes: *there's lots of good options here*
- Introduction to PyTorch: *if you choose this category, consider the entire category to be one of your two resources to work through*, though you will probably be able to skim.
- Introduction on YouTube: *if you choose this category, type out the code yourself*.
- Image and Video: these all look good
- Text: these actually aren't as good because they use different abstractions than the Hugging Face library.
- RL, Deploying, Parallel, Mobile, and Recommendation are more advanced options that may appeal to some students. (We'll do a bit of RL later.)

> **Alternative**: If you prefer, you can instead do the [classifier-from-scratch mini-project](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/22sp/units/06recap/mini-proj/) that we made optional back in Unit 6.

## This Week's Fundamentals

There's only one notebook this week, designed to help you practice with language modeling. As usual, do your work in the corresponding notebook.

- {{% fundamentals name="Logits in Causal Language Models" nbname="u9n1-lm-logits.ipynb" %}}

## Submitting

I recommend working on the other answers outside of Moodle (e.g., in Word or Google Docs), then copy-pasting in.

In the Moodle assignment for this Homework:

1. Attach the `ipynb` file.
2. Copy and paste your responses to the Analysis questions into the text box.
