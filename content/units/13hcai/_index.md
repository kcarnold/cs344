What happens when AI meets people? How can we ensure that AI results are:

- Correct,
- Just, and
- Useful?

The first two are the subject of a subfield called Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency; the last is the subject of much research in human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW). We'll explore all three in these last two weeks of class.

We'll start this week with how we might convince ourselves that model outputs are (or aren't) *correct*.

## Preparation

Background / review: my blog post on [Mapping to Mimicry](https://kenarnold.org/posts/map-to-mimic/).

### Correctness and Transparency / Explainability

Read one or more of these:

- [Explainable AI Guide](https://ex.pegg.io/) ("Your high-level guide to the set of tools and methods that helps humans understand AI/ML models and their predictions.")
- **Interpreting Neural Nets**: Skim one of these articles:
  - [The Building Blocks of Interpretability](https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/)
  - [Activation Atlas](https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/)
  - [Visualizing Neural Networks with the Grand Tour](https://distill.pub/2020/grand-tour/)
  - [Multimodal Neurons in Artificial Neural Networks](https://distill.pub/2021/multimodal-neurons/)
- [Interpretable Machine Learning: Fundamental Principles and 10 Grand Challenges | Abstract](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11251)
- Techniques and limitations of post-hoc interpretability
  - [Problems with Shapley-value-based explanations as feature importance measures](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/kumar20e.html)
  - [The Science Behind InterpretML: SHAP - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-taOhqkiuIo)
- Built-in interpretability: [imodels: leveraging the unreasonable effectiveness of rules â€“ The Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Blog](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2022/02/02/imodels/)
- [Hundreds of AI tools have been built to catch covid. None of them helped. | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/30/1030329/machine-learning-ai-failed-covid-hospital-diagnosis-pandemic)
  > Many unwittingly used a data set that contained chest scans of children who did not have covid as their examples of what non-covid cases looked like. But as a result, the AIs learned to identify kids, not covid.

#### Supplemental Material

- See the "Hall of Fame" list at [5th VISxAI Workshop at IEEE VIS 2022](https://visxai.io/) (also the list of examples under the Call for Participation)
- [PyTorch implementation for Transformer Interpretability Beyond Attention Visualization](https://github.com/hila-chefer/Transformer-Explainability)

### Justice (Fairness, Bias)

- Read one of the articles in [ACM Selects on Algorithmic Fairness](https://selects.acm.org/selections/why-algorithmic-fairness)
- Prefer to watch something? [21 fairness definitions and their politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIXIuYdnyyk)

Supplemental: [The Effects of Regularization and Data Augmentation are Class Dependent | Abstract](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03632)

### Usability

Read or watch something from [Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence](https://hcil.umd.edu/human-centered-ai/).

## Class Meetings

### No Class Monday (Easter Monday)


### Wednesday

- Reminder about course evals
- Project logistics
- Discussion: [PaLM](../12rl/discussion/)
- Q&A (homework, RL, interpretability, ...)
- Lab time

Topics we could discuss:

- Interpretability and Explanation
  - Post-hoc explanation (salience, etc.)
  - Interpretable models
- Human Trust of AI Explanations

Interpretability and Explanation ([slides](/slides/2022-04-20%20Explainable%20and%20Usable.pdf))

### Thursday 4/21

Fairness and Wrap-Up [slides](/slides/2022-04-21%20Fairness%20and%20Wrap-Up.pdf)

Final Discussion topics

- Personal Impacts
  - How AI has impacted my life in the past few years. For better? For worse?
  - How AI has impacted the lives of people unlike me.
  - How AI might impact our lives in the next 5 years.
- Development
  - Something useful or cool that has recently become possible thanks to AI.
  - What are some things that AI systems are already better than humans at?
  - What are some things that humans are still much better at than AI systems?
- Broader impacts
  - Earth Day is tomorrow. Is AI good for the environment? Bad?
  - Is AI good for society? Bad?
  - Is AI good for human creativity? is it bad?
- Christian perspective
  - Something that Christians should consider as people who *consume* AI-powered products
  - ...As people who *use* AI in their organizations
  - ...as people who *develop* AI?
