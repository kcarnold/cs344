## Week 2: Data

I'm excited to have you all in class. The semester start was a bit bumpy for various reasons, but I'm hoping we can settle into a rhythm soon.

### Wrapping up Week 1

Make sure you've done all of the following (check them off in Moodle when you have):

- **welcome survey**
- **Python warm-up quiz**
- **Preparation 1** (reading and quiz)
- **Discussion 1** (actually not due till this coming Wednesday)
- And make sure you've logged onto **Ed** (just click the link on Moodle).

I've set suggested due dates for everything in Moodle; we can continue to discuss the best policy here together. One issue is that since Moodle quizzes lock when they're closed, I'm using the "Expect Completion By" dates for those activities. Those should show up in your Moodle Calendar, but might not show up on the activity itself. I'm looking into this.

### Preparing for Week 2

In week 2 we will start considering what *data* you need to train models. You'll collect some image data yourself and train and evaluate a model. We'll also start looking at some of the ethics of collecting data for AI; we will return to this discussion throughout the semester.

- **Preparation 2** should be done by Monday class. Well, on a typical week it would be. This week is a bit special, see below (and Moodle wasn't configured correctly anyway), so I won't penalize late completions of the Prep reading/quiz this week.
- On **Monday** we'll **meet in the classroom** to review Week 1 (including Lab 1) and start to discuss Week 2.
  - You'll have until we start Lab 2 (i.e., Friday class) to actually finish Lab 1.
- On **Wednesday** we'll have a **guest lecture** from a faculty candidate. Your feedback on his teaching will be helpful in the hiring decision, so please come.
- On **Friday** we'll do Lab 2 on how to tweak and evaluate models, and starting to get into the details of what the data look like.

I'll post the following shortly; they won't be due till the following week:

- the first Review quiz
- another Python study quiz
- the first homework (training your own model)

Locations will be the same as Week 1: Monday and Wednesday are in the classroom (NH 253), Friday in the Gold lab.

I’m here for you. We’re all here for each other. May our Lord give us all strength to persevere, joy in the journey, and love for each other along the way.
