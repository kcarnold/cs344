### Background

In our current world, there is a large push for sustainability. This includes conserving the environment by preserving natural land, reducing carbon emissions, 
developing renewable energy sources, eliminating waste, etc.
In a study assessing the potential impact of AI on the UN's 2017 [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) (which encompasses societal, economic, 
and environmental outcomes), researchers found that AI could potentially enable 93% of the UN's environmental targets.

### Potential Concerns

- energy-intensive GPUs add to environmental degradation
- control (loss?) over large-scale AI systems
- AI making decisions on energy use for homes and cities
- issues with big data

### Provocations

- What is the discerning factor over the trade-off between running highly accurate AI systems and running low energy-intensive AI systems?
- How can AI be used in (smaller?) sustainability efforts without leaving a large carbon footprint?
- What are the ethical design considerations that need to be addressed with large-scale AI systems (i.e. running a power grid)?
