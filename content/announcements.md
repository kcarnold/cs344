## Week 8

- Homework 3 due today, but turning in the Monday after Spring Break counts as only one day late.
  - Many students are plotting the loss for both the training and validation, which is a really good idea.
- Outline on website
- embedding worksheet on Moodle
- [Mid-Semester Survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=uUljdRAGAUuReypKwQ35Rw0bDGF2ImlDp6FjI7QrXehUQzQ0RTM5MktKTVpCMDBYSjIwREFVS0k0SC4u)
- Project proposals: which initiative to join (do this as a survey? Apply to join?)

## Week 7 mid-week

- We had an excellent class meeting today.
  - If you didn't come, I highly recommend you work through the Embeddings Worksheet on your own: [docx](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/23sp/units/07embedding/embedding_worksheet.docx), [PDF](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/23sp/units/07embedding/embedding_worksheet.pdf)
  - Many students were still computing gradients like diligent calculus students, not like neural net coders. We'll review this on Friday.
  - As a warm-up, try writing the code that would compute the gradient as a function of `m1`, no PyTorch.
- Midterm collective exam questions
  - Second question should be done Friday.
  - There are lots of questions about loss function selection already. Review what's already there before you suggest your own.
  - Also first review. Either open a PR suggesting a specific fix, or open an Issue or Discussion with a link to what you're commenting on.
    - To link to a specific line in a file, go to that file, click the `<>` in the bar above the file contents, click the line number, then select "Reference in new issue" from the `...` menu.
    - Use `@` to reference the original author, so they can revise based on your feedback.
  - Many of the learning objectives don't actually match the questions. In some cases that's because I didn't accurately describe the relevant objective on the course website! Suggestions for improvement there count as a Review.
- Homework 3 due Friday also
  - Assignment document suggests a strategy.
  - Students today reported that starting with u05n3 was helpful.
- Lab 6 should be done by Friday also. Remember that the main point is the check-in quizzes on Moodle.
- Projects: share ideas and inspirations in the [Discussion Forum](https://moodle.calvin.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=1575228). Goal: find partners.

See you Friday!

## Week 7

Welcome to unit 7, the week before Spring Break!

In this unit we introduce one of the most powerful concepts in machine learning: the *embedding*. It's the idea that instead of being explicitly given a representation for something, we *learn* it from data *based on the properties it should have*. We've actually already seen embeddings of various kinds (the inputs to the last layer of an image classifier for one), but we'll look at two examples where the embedding aspect is even clearer: movies and words.

News:

1. As usual, during/after the Lab I made some clarifications and improvements to the instructions. One that I'm particularly happy about this year is that I've added code to the NN Regression notebook that shows what *features* the model learned. Have a look at the [preview](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/23sp/fundamentals/u06n3-nn-regression.html) of that notebook.
2. I simplified Homework 3 a bit, to make "doing it the wrong way" an *optional* extension. I've also clarified the strategy suggestions.
3. After Spring Break we'll start on Transformers, which means we'll be using a new textbook. Unfortunately this one doesn't have a free online version. If cost is an issue, talk with me.
4. I recorded a video walking through backpropagation last year that you might find helpful. I had it buried in a private Teams folder, but I just put it up as a [playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYvyo-La3zBMsd_9WAF7MrfjwmkxuXrTb).
5. In lieu of a normal Discussion this week, we get to start thinking about **project ideas**! I've put up a Forum on Moodle for this week if you'd like to pitch an idea and are looking for partners. We'll talk more about projects in class this week; here's the [overall description](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/23sp/project/).

Logistics:

1. Prep 7 is due on Monday as usual.
2. Also due Monday is for you to contribute the first of your Exam Questions; see the [Instructions](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/23sp/exams/).
2. Homework 3 is due on Friday.
3. No discussion this week either.
4. Lab 6 is due on Friday as usual.
5. If you've gotten behind in completing assignments, don't wait until Spring Break to start catching up. Remember our late policy: you can get full Outcome credit for late assignments, but you lose a Process point for each business day late. So getting behind will sting, but catching up is always worth it.
6. Back to normal schedule: Monday and Wednesday in classroom, Friday in lab.

See you Monday in class!


## Week 6: Recap and Regularization

Happy Saturday, Neural Network coders!

The next unit discusses state-of-the-art models (still focusing on computer vision). Weâ€™ll introduce or revisit tools that allow our models to achieve high performance, such as data augmentation and regularization. But we'll actually spend most of our time together getting more practice with how neural networks work from the ground up as we implement our own simple neural net image classifier from scratch (definitely something to mention in an interview!).

Logistics:

- Prep 6 for Monday (note that the quiz is always open through the end of the semester, unlimited attempts, but you must complete it by Monday to get Process credit.)
- We'll meet in the classroom on Monday to review some things, but we'll be in lab on Wednesday and Friday. There's lots of hands-on work to do! This should give you time to finish up Lab 5, which is due on Friday, and also start on Lab 6, which will be due next week as usual.
- In lieu of a Discussion this week, I'd like you to start thinking about your *exam questions*. I've drafted the logistics for this unconventional assessment method; have a look at the [website](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/23sp/exams/). I'll post a few example questions there soon.
- Homework 3 is due the Friday after this (right before Spring Break). It's a big one, so start early!

I've started working on making sure that the [Moodle Calendar](https://moodle.calvin.edu/calendar/view.php?view=month&course=58526) is up to date. I'll try to keep it that way, but if you notice something missing, please let me know.

## Week 5: Learning

Last week we studied the very basics of learning by gradient descent. We implemented one of the simplest possible models--linear regression--and saw how to fit it using gradient descent. This week we'll see how to fit more complex models: we'll change the loss function so that it can perform classification instead of regression, and we'll add a nonlinearity to the model so that it can fit more complex functions. We're well on our way to understanding how to build a neural network!

Logistics:

- Prep 5 should be done by Monday class as usual. (I figured out why some people were confused about the dates on Moodle; I've added separate assignments with the date marked explicitly to make that more clear.) We switched back to the fastai videos, but if you liked the Zero to Hero videos, the next one of those should be fine too.
- Homework 2 is due on Friday. (Homework 3 is already posted on the website, if you want to get a head start.)
- Discussion 2 revisions are due on Wednesday; see instructions on Moodle.
- Discussion 3 continues our theme of practicing how you'd answer questions that you might actually get as an AI expert. See instructions on Moodle.
- The two notebooks for Lab 4 are due on Friday.
- Since this week has Homework, Lab, and Discussion due, we'll skip the Study Quiz and Python Review Quiz this week.

Notes:

If last week's material was unclear for you, I recommend going over the Wednesday activity again; I've made some additions to it to help clarify some of the concepts. I also made some improvements to the Fundamentals notebooks to help explain things better, so if you're still having trouble with those, you might want to download the new versions. (The old version is just fine too.)

I'm working on clarifying the Moodle calendar and grading. You probably got a notification about grades for Labs 1 and 2. If you didn't realize that labs have the Moodle check-in quizzes, I'll allow grace for completing those through this week. The course grades in Moodle are meaningless right now, but I'll be updating them soon.

See you on Monday! As usual, we'll be in the classroom, reviewing last week's material and starting on this week's. Come with questions about the reading or video-watching!

## Week 4: Models

This week we're pulling off the covers to see how these machine learning models actually work. Hang on for the ride, and keep your favorite thing-explainer (ChatGPT, YouTube, etc.) close at hand.

- Prep 4 should be done by Monday class as usual. (I just discovered the date on Moodle was a week off, so the Calendar didn't show it.)
- Now that we've had a few weeks together, let's pick regular due dates that work well for everyone. Specifically, we need weekly dates for Homework, Lab, Discussions, and any weekly Quizzes. We also need to pick a few class meeting days for midterm exams. Please reply to this post on Ed: what would work well for you? What wouldn't?
- I had actually prepared a Fundamentals for this week, but didn't assign it because people asked for more time on Homework 1. But it's probably still good practice, and will help with Homework 2. Find it on the [All Fundamentals](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/23sp/all_fundamentals/) page.
- Homework 2 will be posted this week, due next week (on the day we decide that homework should be due). Here's the [draft](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/23sp/units/03ethics/homework/).
- There's another Study Quiz and Python Practice Quiz up on Moodle. These are for you. e.g., I added a question about random seeds after our discussion about that yesterday.

I forgot something about loss curves on Friday, when mentioning that training loss was higher than validation loss. Training loss gets computed *during training*, and *Dropout* is active during training. We'll talk more about that in a couple of weeks, but for now, the intuition is that the training process *intentionally handicaps the model* to avoid overfitting.

See you Monday! Remember to come with questions about the reading or video-watching.

## Week 2: Data

I'm excited to have you all in class. The semester start was a bit bumpy for various reasons, but I'm hoping we can settle into a rhythm soon.

### Wrapping up Week 1

Make sure you've done all of the following (check them off in Moodle when you have):

- **welcome survey**
- **Python warm-up quiz**
- **Preparation 1** (reading and quiz)
- **Discussion 1** (actually not due till this coming Wednesday)
- And make sure you've logged onto **Ed** (just click the link on Moodle).

I've set suggested due dates for everything in Moodle; we can continue to discuss the best policy here together. One issue is that since Moodle quizzes lock when they're closed, I'm using the "Expect Completion By" dates for those activities. Those should show up in your Moodle Calendar, but might not show up on the activity itself. I'm looking into this.

### Preparing for Week 2

In week 2 we will start considering what *data* you need to train models. You'll collect some image data yourself and train and evaluate a model. We'll also start looking at some of the ethics of collecting data for AI; we will return to this discussion throughout the semester.

- **Preparation 2** should be done by Monday class. Well, on a typical week it would be. This week is a bit special, see below (and Moodle wasn't configured correctly anyway), so I won't penalize late completions of the Prep reading/quiz this week.
- On **Monday** we'll **meet in the classroom** to review Week 1 (including Lab 1) and start to discuss Week 2.
  - You'll have until we start Lab 2 (i.e., Friday class) to actually finish Lab 1.
- On **Wednesday** we'll have a **guest lecture** from a faculty candidate. Your feedback on his teaching will be helpful in the hiring decision, so please come.
- On **Friday** we'll do Lab 2 on how to tweak and evaluate models, and starting to get into the details of what the data look like.

I'll post the following shortly; they won't be due till the following week:

- the first Review quiz
- another Python study quiz
- the first homework (training your own model)

Locations will be the same as Week 1: Monday and Wednesday are in the classroom (NH 253), Friday in the Gold lab.

Iâ€™m here for you. Weâ€™re all here for each other. May our Lord give us all strength to persevere, joy in the journey, and love for each other along the way.
